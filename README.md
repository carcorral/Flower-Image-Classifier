# Flower-Image-Classifier
Create a neural network model with Pytorch to predict what kind of flower the picture show
## Dataset available at:
We'll be using [this dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) of 102 flower categories. 
## Steps:
* Load and process the dataset
* Train the image classifier on your dataset
* Use the trained classifier to predict image content
* Create scripts to be used from the command shell
